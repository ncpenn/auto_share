# Auto Share PoshMark Bookmarklet for Google Chrome

    Automatically share all "active listings" in your poshmark closet. 

This script automates the clicks needed to share your poshmark closet. First, it repeatedly scrolls to the bottom of the page in your poshmark closet in order to load all your items. Next, it will grab all the listings, filtering out those that do not have a **Sold** or **Not For Sale** tag. Lastly, it will iterate through the listings, triggering click events on each listing's share link and finally clicking the **To My Followers** link on the share modal.

## Disclaimer

This script is not supported by Poshmark and simply automates user behaviors in the Poshmark UI as of December 2018. A variety of UI changes or changes to the Poshmark application will cause this script to fail. Additionally, PoshMark seems to have API request limits for some of their services. These limits may cause share requests that are too close together to fail. Use at your own risk.
